    On Living Stones and Reaching
    <br>
    <br>
    *To speak of this work, is to attempt to do something quite strange. You see, to speak, or to articulate, is very often than not, a means of defining something: to make it known, recognised, to form boundaries of what it is and how it works; seemingly satisfying for both I, the artist, and you, the reader. And it is only now that I recognise, after quite a few years of thinking the opposite, of how troublesome that can be, how dissatisfying, for the work to be betrothed to words before it is even felt on its own; and feeling, or rather, sometimes, the lack of it, is what drives us forward.*

    *Let me put it in another way: what I’ve never really understood, as a young artist, when mingling, say at a gallery opening, or at a talk, is when someone would utter the illustrious phrase: it’s a research project; firstly, it’s normally said in a tone designed to condescend, as if I just wouldn’t get it; secondly, and what I feel might be the true reason: they don’t really understand it yet, they are embarrassed, and sense if they were to divulge it, they would jeopardise the work itself. I’ve never really got that: a trepidation in seeing it slip through my hands, like sand between my fingers. I’ve always been quite comfortable speaking about it, to most people, whether it was rehearsed or not, I knew the rhythm. But here, here in the present, emerges the slippage between then and now, as today, at this very moment, I do not know it. I feel adrift in a sea of otherness; it pervades me, washes over me, like goosebumps on my skin. The work seeks to defy words. And as easily as glass cracks, I do not wish to break the image you have formed of it. In the light of this, I wondered whether you’d be interested in navigating us a little differently: instead of reciting what I think, and lying in the process, might we choose to discuss what surrounds it? I feel them shimmering like stars, as these clusters of thoughts, spin, orbiting around us. Through them I have learnt to see further and deeper than ever before.*

    *The title draws from the notion, or the experience, of double taking: a glance, which often reveals something unsuspected, or overlooked. What I thought I saw is not what I thought I saw. It reminded me of my initial visit to the site of the work, the greenhouse, and to the trickery its glass panels played, on my mind and my eyes. To visit it, was to enter a world of appearances, a curiously fractured and refracted world of sight; a field of disbelief, and illusion. This sensation was supported by decades of decay, as the greenhouse, fallen into disrepair, only faintly resembled itself, like a face, or a body, withering, sixty years on from the date of a photograph. Through this ruin form I found within it a kind of disruption, or an assault, upon the usual order of things. I was drawn to it, hungering for its flux in time; I saw it as a vessel, a ship of glass, floating amongst a sea, as black as the night, crashing against great waves of foliage. It is something which still pushes me toward a profound question: what is the truth of it? The truth of what shrouds us, and, momentously, the nature of seeing itself. I felt akin to André Breton, who desired to live, entirely, in a glasshouse, for all the clarity and cohesion it would bring to the character which was himself. I sensed I would find things there, or an inquiry as to why it is, and how I perhaps, came to be there.*
