    Image: Growing, Photographing, Writing* an introduction to *On Living Stones and
    Reaching* by Jonathan P. Watts:\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n*Photo-graphy*, grafted. Individually
    these two words derive, according to Wikipedia, from the Greek meaning ‘light’
    and ‘drawing’. And yet it is ‘*Words of light*’ – straitening the difference between
    drawing and script – that William Henry Fox Talbot named photography in notebook
    ‘P’ on 3 March 1839.\n<br>\n<br>\nBotanical specimens were one of Fox Talbot’s
    most repeated subjects of the early ‘photogenic drawings’ and is said to have
    inspired Anna Atkins’ taxonomical cyanotypes of ferns and algae. The early abundance
    of contact prints using flora and fauna, requiring sun and water for processing,
    has led some to suggest that photography was ‘born in the garden’.<sup>1</sup>\n<br>\n<br>\nElsewhere
    in notebook ‘P’, methodically kept throughout March and April of that year, photography
    is understood as an occult medium for the automatic self-portraiture of nature:
    ‘magic pictures’ and ‘nature’s marvels’ appear among spring’s unfurling leaves.<sup>2</sup>
    Propagated on paper, images gestate and grow; are cultivated and shared.\n<br>\n<br>\nTo
    behold Fox Talbot’s later folio of lens-based calotypes, *The Pencil of Nature*
    (1844), is, writes Jean-Christophe Bailly in *The Instant and its Shadow*, to
    be:\n<br>\n<br>\nat the source of a new art, and what *The Pencil of Nature* allows
    us to hear or grasp is indeed the sound of that source, at the place where it
    is wholly originated, if not regulated by some scheme of nature at work, functioning
    directly in the darkroom and in the fixing of the image on the paper.<sup>3</sup>\n<br>\n<br>\nAlexander
    Mourant’s body of work *On Living Stones and Reaching* (all works 2020) returns
    photography to the garden from which it came. It returned Mourant, too, to the
    garden from which he came. Produced over three months in and around an acre field
    in Trinity, Jersey, on the land where Mourant’s family have farmed the Jersey
    Royal potato for 140 years, sixteen works across analogue lens-based photography,
    cyanotype contact prints, Super 8 moving image, co-ordinated performance and writing
    amount to a laborious attempt at hearing and grasping photography’s source.\n<br>\n<br>\nOnce
    the field had been ploughed and furrowed (*How to Plant an Image*), Mourant, working
    over a period of five gruelling days, hand planted 30,000 potatoes across 52 furrows
    of earth. He did so, he explains, ‘with the intent of reaching one image, 83 days
    later, of the field matured, and ready for harvest’.<sup>4</sup> The crop, sensitive
    to light energy and water, is the image and the field is the frame. *Portrait
    of the Artist Repeating Himself* (Days 1–5), a sequence of 26 self-portraits shot
    at the end of each two rows of planted furrow, is the basis for stages of cultivation
    – growth, harvest, circulation and consumption – that are the pretext for further
    works in the series.<sup>5</sup>\n<br>\n<br>\nHow, as a 21st-century photographer,
    does one remain alert to what photography proposes? Bailly identifies in Fox Talbot’s
    *The Pencil of Nature* ‘a kind of exclamatory joy linked to a climate of absolute
    opening’, which, I think, Mourant recognises too. Mourant seeks the absolute opening
    to, as he puts it, ‘expand’ photography, to ‘unlearn’ what he thinks he knows
    about photography in order to ‘derestrict’ it. At the place where it wholly originated,
    photography could still be anything.<sup>6</sup>\n<br>\n<br>\n*On Living Stones
    and Reaching* is a procedural body of work and the serial presentation of individual
    works such as *Portrait of the Artist Repeating Himself*, *Teaching the Camera
    How to Carry*, and *Five Sketches Running for Two Hundred and Ten Seconds* or
    *Five Furrows* evokes Euro-North American land art of the 1960s and ‘70s. Unlike
    much of this work, which often regarded the photograph as a secondary, lesser
    souvenir of the action and site, Mourant labours in the field for the sake of
    the image alone.\n<br>\n<br>\nOf the land artists who planted crops – among them,
    famously, Agnes Denes and Hans Haacke – it is Dennis Oppenheim’s two works *Directed
    Seeding* and *Cancelled Crop* (1969) that Mourant is most compelled by. In the
    latter, Oppenheim harvested the form of an ‘X’ across a wheatfield. ‘Planting
    and cultivating my own material,’ he wrote:\n<br>\n<br>\nis like mining ones [sic]
    own pigment (for paint) – I can direct the later stages of development at will.
    In this case the material is planted and cultivated for the sole purpose of withholding
    it from a product-oriented system. Isolating this grain from further processing
    (production of food stuffs) becomes like stopping raw pigment from becoming an
    illusionistic force on canvas.<sup>7</sup>\n<br>\n<br>\nFiguring the wheat as
    an artistic medium, linking it to extractive capitalist processes of mining, Oppenheim
    withholds the grain’s entry into the system of commodity exchange and circulation,
    questioning the relationship between artistic labour of production and agricultural
    labour of production. It is Mourant as ‘artist’ and not ‘labourer’ who is portrayed
    repeating himself.<sup>8</sup> How, thinking with Mourant’s work, are the processes
    of photography analogous to the processes of farming?\n<br>\n<br>\nMourant’s attitude
    to photography connects with Fox Talbot’s understanding of it as an occult medium
    for the automatic self-portraiture of nature. There is a sense throughout the
    work that the camera is not a tool operated to frame the world, but, rather, a
    more agential recipient of nature’s marvels. Crop in the field, conceived as an
    image, is living and growing and reveals itself by its own vegetal duration. Mourant
    is alert to the way a contemporary posthumanist philosophy of photography, critical
    of human-centric frameworks and discourses, is already at the source of the medium.<sup>9</sup>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe
    very day after planting, 2 April 2020, Mourant commenced a daily methodical (gruelling)
    practice of writing, described as a ‘durational text’, that was completed on 23
    June 2020, the day before harvest. Titled *The Wilderness of Words*, this experimental
    text ranges between writerly voices, registers and positions, speaking with the
    image in the field. Reflections on the experience of planting the field merge
    with the stories Mourant told himself as he planted – a body performing mechanical
    gestures. Direct quotations of others appear in italics. Writing of the self is
    opened up to fiction, suffused by the cacophonous voices of others.\n<br>\n<br>\nWriting
    is at photography's source. ‘Photography,’ writes the philosopher Eduardo Cadava,
    ‘is nothing else than a writing of light, a script of light, what Talbot elsewhere
    called “the pencil of nature”.’<sup>10</sup> Cadava plugs Talbot into Walter Benjamin
    who believed that without the event of language, without the corresponding emergence
    of an image, there can be no history:\n<br>\n<br>\n*Words of light.* This phrase
    also names the relation between language and light, between language and the possibility
    of lucidity, and of knowledge in general.<sup>11</sup>\n<br>\n<br>\nWords of light,
    in the example of Talbot, are inseparable from the act of writing and naming in
    notebooks. If the field is a kind of cultivation, the writing is, for Mourant,
    I think, a wilderness. Whereas a seed, such as a potato, anticipates a future
    crop that is more or less knowable, writing, whatever else it is for Mourant,
    is elucidated in the act of doing.\n<br>\n<br>\nWriting in her recent gardening
    column for *The New Yorker*, Jamaica Kincaid differentiated between agriculture
    and horticulture. ‘[T]he Tree of Life is agriculture and the Tree of Knowledge
    is horticulture.’ ‘We cultivate food,’ she writes:\n<br>\n<br>\nand when there
    is a surplus of it, producing wealth, we cultivate the spaces of contemplation,
    a garden of plants not necessary for physical survival. The awareness of that
    fact is what gives the garden its special, powerful place in our lives and our
    imaginations.<sup>12</sup>\n<br>\n<br>\nHorticulture of a garden is not agriculture
    of a field. Discussing *Artist’s Sister Amongst the Image*, Mourant proposes an
    equivalency between the plant and the pixel, as Oppenheim equates grain and pigment.
    The plant is the material substrate, but one pixel in a matrix of pixels that
    make up the image.<sup>13</sup> Agriculture, as Kincaid suggests, is a calculated
    process of surplus production required for physical survival. The garden fuels
    the imagination. Because the garden is not *necessary* for survival it is cherished
    even more. Mourant’s crop speaks to ideas of heritage, family, land, necessary
    work and survival. As artwork, the crop opens up a space of contemplation.\n<br>\n<br>\nFor
    the final work in *On Living Stones and Reaching*, *The Image Begins Anew*, Mourant
    posted the Jersey Royals that he grew – the material substrate of the image –
    to his friends, the artists Victoria Louise Doyle and Krasimira Butseva. Planted
    or boiled, contemplated or eaten, the image is cultivated and shared, and begins
    anew.\n<br>\n<br>\n– Born in Great Yarmouth, Jonathan P. Watts lives in Norwich.\n<br>\n<br>\n---------<br>\n<sup>1</sup>

    The early colour photographic process known as the ‘autochrome’ was developed
    by the Lumière brothers by coating a glass plate with a wash of potato starch
    grains. This curio is missed by Rebecca Earle in the book *potato* (ObjectLessons,
    Bloomsbury, 2019), which opens with Kevin Abosch, an Irish artist who produces
    photographic portraits of potatoes ‘as a proxy for the ontological study of human
