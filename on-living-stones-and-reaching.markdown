    ## On living stones and reaching

    Multidisciplinary earthwork made in 2020, rooted in the theory of photography, literature and Land Art. Over a period of five gruelling days, I planted 30,000 potatoes, across 52 furrows of earth, on an acre of land, on the island of Jersey. I did so with the simple intent of reaching one image, 83 days later, of the field matured, and ready for harvest. Acting primarily as a meditation on the nature of environment, labour and ancestry, the work proliferates and deepens metaphysically, to question the formation and transformation of images.

    Alongside documentation of this performance and Super 8 films, the centre of the work consists of a self-reflexive piece of prose, titled The Wilderness of Words. The total text, which was borne diligently, an entry a day, amounts to 28,000 words.
