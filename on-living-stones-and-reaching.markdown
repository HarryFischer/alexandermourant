    # On Living Stones and Reaching
    <br>
    <br>
    *On Living Stones and Reaching is a multidisciplinary artwork rooted in the theory of photography and earthworks. Over a period of five gruelling days, I planted 30,000 potatoes, across 52 furrows, on just under an acre of land, on the island of Jersey (Channel Islands, UK). I did so with the simple intent of reaching **one** pure image, 83 days later, of the field matured; rich, green and ready for harvest.

    Acting primarily as a meditation on the nature of environment, labour and ancestry, the work proliferates and deepens metaphysically, to question the formation and transformation of images. Do I travel towards images, or do images travel towards me? Where do they begin, and where do they end? By employing photography, photograms, Super 8, performance and text, I sought to embrace numerous languages, to gain a greater intimacy and insight into the enigmatic relationship laying at the heart of artist and the artwork.*

    *By employing autobiography, literature and reference-based thinking, I create narratives and analogies that explore the relationship between the body and the photographic medium. My work is a deeply rooted investigation into contemporary and archaic agriculture, and it participates in a variety of activities, such as digging, planting and harvesting, in an attempt to uncover parallelism between action and theoretical discourse. I regularly embody my research practice to draw on methodologies cultivated by the 1960s Land Art movement, Performance and Arte Povera, to help question, or push, our understanding of the photographic. I propose how images may deal with temporality, spatiality and reflexivity, through new ways of thinking, and elude to the photographic becoming a space among space, and ultimately, a place we traverse.*
