  entry-heading-text: North East South West (2020)
  entry-body-text: Place a camera on a tripod in the centre of a field with long grass,
    ideally in summer, just before the grass is harvested. Point the camera towards
    north. The artist holding a strimmer and a 10m shutter release (attached to the
    camera), must walk away from the camera in a straight line whilst strimming. The
    artist must walk as far away as the shutter cable will allow. Once maximum extension
    is reached, the artist must face right, and take a photograph. Whilst strimming,
    the artist must then walk in a clockwise direction, around the camera, guided
    by, and at full extension of, the shutter cable, in order to create a perfect
    circle around the camera at a 10m distance. Artist must stop at each quarter of
    the circle to take a photograph (east, south and west, before returning to north).
    An assistant must swivel the camera on its tripod head to point the lens towards
    the artist. Once the outer circle line is completed, remove the camera from the
    centre, and strim the remaining grass and inner area of the circle. To finish,
    photograph the circle from outside the circle.

  entry-heading-text: TRIPOD (after Lew Thomas) (2020)
  entry-body-text: 'On a bright summer’s day, place a camera on a tripod onto a large
    sheet of cyanotype sensitised paper (approximately 3 x 2m). Point the camera downwards,
    towards the paper, and take a photograph. The camera will photograph its own shadow
    and that of the tripod’s on the paper. As the apparatus continues to create a
    shadow on the paper, the cyanotype will expose and record its presence as a photogram.
    After the exposure, remove the camera and tripod and wash / fix the paper. Once
    dry, place the paper on the floor, then place the camera and tripod back on the
    same spot it once stood (indicated by the recorded shadow on the cyanotype). This
    setup now becomes a permanent sculpture - the camera, tripod and cyanotype paper
    are never to be separated. On the wall behind the sculpture, place the framed
    photograph that the camera took when initially recording its own shadow exposing
    on the cyanotype. With an additonal camera, photograph this sculpture/installation
    as a work in its own right. Frame and place this installation photograph on the
    wall directly next to the original photograph made by the camera which has now
    become a sculpture. Every time the work is shown in an exhibition, an additional
    installation photograph must be taken, framed, and then placed on the wall, next
    to the original photographs, which then in turn becomes a part of the piece. '

    and awaits framing. It's an additonal work that joins the ongoing series, *I Could
    Not Tell Glass from Air*. \n"

  entry-heading-text: An Image That Holds Its Heat (2020)
  entry-body-text: Purchase or construct a large Victorian cloche. Remove the glass
    panels and print images of the greenhouses onto the glass plates via collodion
    process. Alternatively, lay ivy or other flora found at the greenhouses onto sensitised
    collodion glass plates and create a photogram. Reassemble cloche with collodion
    glass plates. Present collodion cloche as sculpture on thin steel plinth.

  entry-body-text: Multiple miniature collodion cloches with a panel of glass making
    up each of its four sides with additional four triangle sections for the “roof”.
    Place groups of these cloches, forming clusters, around the exhibition space,
    in the corners and centre of the space.

  entry-body-text: 'Thin steel pyramid frame sculpture (approximately 2m H x 60cm
    W). Place small triangular piece of glass that has an image printed on it via
    collodion process at the top. At the base of the pyramid, place a triangular silver
    gelatin print that has been exposed by using the small triangular piece of glass
    as a negative. '

    Artist to place a steel vitrine (approximately 2m x 90cm) in a studio space. Ensure the base of the vitrine is replaced with a sheet of clear rigid acrylic. Prepare hundreds of collodion plate negatives that depict the subject of the greenhouse. To record the following performance, position a camera with a view of the vitrine with space either side for the Artist to walk. Over an unspecified length of time, the Artist will throw and drop collodion plate negatives into the vitrine. It is expected the glass plates will shatter, causing shards and fragments of images to scatter at random across the base of the vitrine. Artist to continue dropping negatives until every negative is shattered. Once complete, stop the camera from filming.<br>
    <br>
    In the darkroom, the Artist will create a large photogram on silver gelatin paper that records the chance shapes and interactions created by the glass shards falling into the vitrine. After developing a successful print, the Artist is then required to collect all the shattered glass negatives from the vitrine, and reperform the process. The Artist continuously reorders the images in the vitrine through the medium of chance, and documents the iterations generated via silver gelatin photogram prints.<br>
    <br>
    The resulting prints should be exhibited hung in a line on a wall. The vitrine with remaining glass shards sits in the centre of the exhibition space. The walls are painted dark grey of black with soft spotlights, bathing the interior of the vitrine and silver gelatine prints with light. The installation is accompanied by the original sound recordings of the greenhouse site by musician Lorenzo Burgio.
