  entry-body-text: Place a camera on a tripod in the centre of a field with long grass,
    ideally in summer, just before the grass is harvested. Point the camera towards
    north. The artist holding a strimmer and a 10m shutter release (attached to the
    camera), must walk away from the camera in a straight line whilst strimming. The
    artist must walk as far away as the shutter cable will allow. Once maximum extension
    is reached, the artist must face right, and take a photograph. Whilst strimming,
    the artist must then walk in a clockwise direction, around the camera, guided
    by, and at full extension of, the shutter cable, in order to create a perfect
    circle around the camera at a 10m distance. Artist must stop at each quarter of
    the circle to take a photograph (east, south and west, before returning to north).
    An assistant must swivel the camera on its tripod head to point the lens towards
    the artist. Once the outer circle line is completed, remove the camera from the
    centre, and strim the remaining grass and inner area of the circle. To finish,
    photograph the circle from outside the circle.

  entry-heading-text: TRIPOD (after Lew Thomas) (2020)
  entry-body-text: 'On a bright summer’s day, place a camera on a tripod onto a large
    sheet of cyanotype sensitised paper (approximately 3 x 2m). Point the camera downwards,
    towards the paper, and take a photograph. The camera will photograph its own shadow
    and that of the tripod’s on the paper. As the apparatus continues to create a
    shadow on the paper, the cyanotype will expose and record its presence as a photogram.
    After the exposure, remove the camera and tripod and wash / fix the paper. Once
    dry, place the paper on the floor, then place the camera and tripod back on the
    same spot it once stood (indicated by the recorded shadow on the cyanotype). This
    setup now becomes a permanent sculpture - the camera, tripod and cyanotype paper
    are never to be separated. On the wall behind the sculpture, place the framed
    photograph that the camera took when initially recording its own shadow exposing
    on the cyanotype. With an additonal camera, photograph this sculpture/installation
    as a work in its own right. Frame and place this installation photograph on the
    wall directly next to the original photograph made by the camera which has now
    become a sculpture. Every time the work is shown in an exhibition, an additional
    installation photograph must be taken, framed, and then placed on the wall, next
    to the original photographs, which then in turn becomes a part of the piece. '
