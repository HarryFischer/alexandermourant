  entry-body-text: Place a camera on a tripod in the centre of a field with long grass,
    ideally in summer, just before the grass is harvested. Point the camera towards
    north. The artist holding a strimmer and a 10m shutter release (attached to the
    camera), must walk away from the camera in a straight line whilst strimming. The
    artist must walk as far away as the shutter cable will allow. Once maximum extension
    is reached, the artist must face right, and take a photograph. Whilst strimming,
    the artist must then walk in a clockwise direction, around the camera, guided
    by, and at full extension of, the shutter cable, in order to create a perfect
    circle around the camera at a 10m distance. Artist must stop at each quarter of
    the circle to take a photograph (east, south and west, before returning to north).
    An assistant must swivel the camera on its tripod head to point the lens towards
    the artist. Once the outer circle line is completed, remove the camera from the
    centre, and strim the remaining grass and inner area of the circle. To finish,
    photograph the circle from outside the circle.
