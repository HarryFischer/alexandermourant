  entry-body-text: "*This section presents artworks that I am currently unable to
    create, due to time pressures, space requirements or lack of funds. Often, for
    emerging artists, the ability to create artworks requires the harmonious meeting
    of not just one, but all three of these elements simultaneously: time, space and
    money.*<br> \n<br>\n*As a conceptual artist, many of my works are rigorously considered,
    and have references and meaning already assigned before creation. It is frustrating
    that these works live within my mind, and in a sense, are already created, it’s
    just I cannot yet transfer them to you without a physical materialisation. Each
    work is marked by the year it was conceived.*<br> \n<br>\n*It is my hope this
    page will serve as a catalogue, representing the artworks I intend to create in
    the future. If you are interested in learning more about a particular work, or
    wish to commission or help realise the production of a piece, please do get in
    touch. I am very open to collaboration and dedicated to the creation of these
    works for exhibitions or private collections.*<br>\n<br> \n**Contact: alexander@alexandermourant.com**"

  entry-heading-text: North East South West (2020)
  entry-body-text: Place a camera on a tripod in the centre of a field with long grass,
    ideally in summer, just before the grass is harvested. Point the camera towards
    north. The artist holding a strimmer and a 10m shutter release (attached to the
    camera), must walk away from the camera in a straight line whilst strimming. The
    artist must walk as far away as the shutter cable will allow. Once maximum extension
    is reached, the artist must face right, and take a photograph. Whilst strimming,
    the artist must then walk in a clockwise direction, around the camera, guided
    by, and at full extension of, the shutter cable, in order to create a perfect
    circle around the camera at a 10m distance. Artist must stop at each quarter of
    the circle to take a photograph (east, south and west, before returning to north).
    An assistant must swivel the camera on its tripod head to point the lens towards
    the artist. Once the outer circle line is completed, remove the camera from the
    centre, and strim the remaining grass and inner area of the circle. To finish,
    photograph the circle from outside the circle.

  entry-heading-text: TRIPOD (after Lew Thomas) (2020)
  entry-body-text: 'On a bright summer’s day, place a camera on a tripod onto a large
    sheet of cyanotype sensitised paper (approximately 3 x 2m). Point the camera downwards,
    towards the paper, and take a photograph. The camera will photograph its own shadow
    and that of the tripod’s on the paper. As the apparatus continues to create a
    shadow on the paper, the cyanotype will expose and record its presence as a photogram.
    After the exposure, remove the camera and tripod and wash / fix the paper. Once
    dry, place the paper on the floor, then place the camera and tripod back on the
    same spot it once stood (indicated by the recorded shadow on the cyanotype). This
    setup now becomes a permanent sculpture - the camera, tripod and cyanotype paper
    are never to be separated. On the wall behind the sculpture, place the framed
    photograph that the camera took when initially recording its own shadow exposing
    on the cyanotype. With an additonal camera, photograph this sculpture/installation
    as a work in its own right. Frame and place this installation photograph on the
    wall directly next to the original photograph made by the camera which has now
    become a sculpture. Every time the work is shown in an exhibition, an additional
    installation photograph must be taken, framed, and then placed on the wall, next
    to the original photographs, which then in turn becomes a part of the piece. '

  entry-heading-text: An Image That Holds Its Heat (2020)
  entry-body-text: Purchase or construct a large Victorian cloche. Remove the glass
    panels and print images of the greenhouses onto the glass plates via collodion
    process. Alternatively, lay ivy or other flora found at the greenhouses onto sensitised
    collodion glass plates and create a photogram. Reassemble cloche with collodion
    glass plates. Present collodion cloche as sculpture on thin steel plinth.

  entry-body-text: 'Thin steel pyramid frame sculpture (approximately 2m H x 60cm
    W). Place small triangular piece of glass that has an image printed on it via
    collodion process at the top. At the base of the pyramid, place a triangular silver
    gelatin print that has been exposed by using the small triangular piece of glass
    as a negative. '

  entry-heading-text: A Performance to Ask the Image to Collaborate (2020)
  entry-body-text: |-
    Artist to place a steel vitrine (approximately 2m x 90cm) in a studio space. Ensure the base of the vitrine is replaced with a sheet of clear rigid acrylic. Prepare hundreds of collodion plate negatives that depict the subject of the greenhouse. To record the following performance, position a camera with a view of the vitrine with space either side for the Artist to walk. Over an unspecified length of time, the Artist will throw and drop collodion plate negatives into the vitrine. It is expected the glass plates will shatter, causing shards and fragments of images to scatter at random across the base of the vitrine. Artist to continue dropping negatives until every negative is shattered. Once complete, stop the camera from filming.<br>
    <br>
    In the darkroom, the Artist will create a large photogram on silver gelatin paper that records the chance shapes and interactions created by the glass shards falling into the vitrine. After developing a successful print, the Artist is then required to collect all the shattered glass negatives from the vitrine, and reperform the process. The Artist continuously reorders the images in the vitrine through the medium of chance, and documents the iterations generated via silver gelatin photogram prints.<br>
    <br>
    The resulting prints should be exhibited hung in a line on a wall. The vitrine with remaining glass shards sits in the centre of the exhibition space. The walls are painted dark grey of black with soft spotlights, bathing the interior of the vitrine and silver gelatine prints with light. The installation is accompanied by the original sound recordings of the greenhouse site by musician Lorenzo Burgio.

  entry-heading-text: An Image Emerges from the Forest (2020)
  entry-body-text: Durational assemblage silver gelatin photogram piece (1.2 x 3m)
    with ivy, framed in steel. In the darkroom, hang a sheet of fibre-based paper
    (1.2 x 3m) on the wall. Next, layer a “curtain” of ivy on top of the paper. Once
    completed, stand back and make an exposure using torch lights. An image of the
    ivy will be recorded as a photogram on the paper. To finish the work, frame the
    print in a large steel frame and place the curtain of ivy hanging, within the
    frame, but 8cm away from the print. The ivy object will obscure its own image.
    Photograph the work installed on a gallery wall. During the exhibition and lifespan
    of the work, the hanging ivy will decay and rot slowly over time, eventually falling
    from the piece and revealing its image in its wake.

  entry-heading-text: The Instant and Its Shadow (2020)
  entry-body-text: 'This work is related to An Image Emerges from the Forest (2020)
    but utilises other flora to create a photogram assemblage work. For this piece,
    take a branch from a fallen tree, and create a photogram of it on a large sheet
    of silver gelatin paper (approx 2m x 5m). Scale for this piece will vary depending
    on the resources available and feasibility of creation. Once the photogram is
    made, place it inside a large steel vitrine, or low lying tray frame. This installation
    can be displayed in two ways: first, place the print on the floor of the space,
    and hang the branch horizontally from the roof, directly above the print, leaving
    approximately an 80cm gap; second, frame the print in a large, vertical, floor
    standing vitrine / tray frame, and place in the exhibition space, then position
    the branch upright too, with the help of steel supports directly in front of the
    print, leaving an 80cm gap.'

  entry-heading-text: A Sculpture That Sees (2020)
  entry-body-text: Wide reaching multiple arm interconnecting sculpture that has a
    mixture of collodion plate photographs, organic materials and silver gelatin photograms,
    arranged in such a way that the movement around, and through the sculpture, brings
    into view the alignment and potential ‘formation’ of images. This work seeks to
    materialise the physical equivalence of a mental image process when visiting and
    photographing a given space.

  entry-body-text: Performance sculpture using glass splashback (approximately 50cm
    x 3m) from the Artist’s family kitchen. In the studio space, the Artist will place
    the glass on the floor, and gently lift one end, slowly increasing the gradient
    of the glass until it’s almost vertical, but continuously held by the support
    of the Artist. Take a photograph to document the Artist supporting the weight
    of the glass.
