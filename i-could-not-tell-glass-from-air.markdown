- interview-text: "# I Could Not Tell Glass From Air\n<br>\n<br>\nTo speak of this
    work, is to attempt to do something quite strange. You see, to speak, or to articulate,
    is very often than not, a means of defining something: to make it known, recognised,
    to form boundaries of what it is and how it works; seemingly satisfying for both
    I, the artist, and you, the reader. And it is only now that I recognise, after
    quite a few years of thinking the opposite, of how troublesome that can be, how
    dissatisfying, for the work to be betrothed to words before it is even felt on
    its own; and feeling, or rather, sometimes, the lack of it, is what drives us
    forward.\n<br>\n<br>\nLet me put it in another way: what I’ve never really understood,
    as a young artist, when mingling, say at a gallery opening, or at a talk, is when
    someone would utter the illustrious phrase: it’s a research project; firstly,
    it’s normally said in a tone designed to condescend, as if I just wouldn’t get
    it; secondly, and what I feel might be the true reason: they don’t really understand
    it yet, they are embarrassed, and sense if they were to divulge it, they would
    jeopardise the work itself. I’ve never really got that: a trepidation in seeing
    it slip through my hands, like sand between my fingers. I’ve always been quite
    comfortable speaking about it, to most people, whether it was rehearsed or not,
    I knew the rhythm. But here, here in the present, emerges the slippage between
    then and now, as today, at this very moment, I do not know it. I feel adrift in
    a sea of otherness; it pervades me, washes over me, like goosebumps on my skin.
    The work seeks to defy words. And as easily as glass cracks, I do not wish to
    break the image you have formed of it. In the light of this, I wondered whether
    you’d be interested in navigating us a little differently: instead of reciting
    what I think, and lying in the process, might we choose to discuss what surrounds
    it? I feel them shimmering like stars, as these clusters of thoughts, spin, orbiting
    around us. Through them I have learnt to see further and deeper than ever before.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe
    title draws from the notion, or the experience, of double taking: a glance, which
    often reveals something unsuspected, or overlooked. What I thought I saw is not
    what I thought I saw. It reminded me of my initial visit to the site of the work,
    the greenhouse, and to the trickery its glass panels played, on my mind and my
    eyes. To visit it, was to enter a world of appearances, a curiously fractured
    and refracted world of sight; a field of disbelief, and illusion. This sensation
    was supported by decades of decay, as the greenhouse, fallen into disrepair, only
    faintly resembled itself, like a face, or a body, withering, sixty years on from
    the date of a photograph. Through this ruin form I found within it a kind of disruption,
    or an assault, upon the usual order of things. I was drawn to it, hungering for
    its flux in time; I saw it as a vessel, a ship of glass, floating amongst a sea,
    as black as the night, crashing against great waves of foliage. It is something
    which still pushes me toward a profound question: what is the truth of it? The
    truth of what shrouds us, and, momentously, the nature of seeing itself. I felt
    akin to André Breton, who desired to live, entirely, in a glasshouse, for all
    the clarity and cohesion it would bring to the character which was himself. I
    sensed I would find things there, or an inquiry as to why it is, and how I perhaps,
    came to be there. \n<br>\n<br>\nIt dawned on me a while ago that the greenhouse
    is essentially a house of windows. A structure, or a sculpture, for seeing, and
    seeing through. Baudelaire speaks about windows, and how the world can only, truly,
    be seen through windows, and this seeing needs glass, it needs the separation
    and distance provided by it, in order to see the outside for what it is. And somehow
    it's the distance, mediated by the glass, by not touching it, that makes the sensation
    of seeing, seem further; moreover, glass is a material which exists in the in-between,
    it is liminal (a term born in *The Forest of Symbols* by Victor Turner): dividing
    interior and exterior; inside and outside; here and there. It exists in a grey
    space, but it is a threshold too. And does this description not remind you of
    another? For me, I felt it analogous to the camera; more so, the children of it:
    photographs. Physically, they are the in-between: there's me, here, and over there,
    there's the thing, the subject; and what do I place in-between those two things:
    the camera, of course. What's more, not to be Barthes about it, but, it’s not
    quite dead, and not quite living, is it? The photograph, I mean. It exists in
    a space of neither day nor night. Of neither life nor death. It’s a twilight art,
    as Sontag said: it’s a marker for a reality within itself. And I found that intoxicating.
    To be walking inside it, amid photographs and a structure, which I came to see
    as the apparatus of seeing, rupturing, in front of my eyes. \n<br>\n<br>\nFrustratingly,
    I've found just one reading will never do; it's constantly reread, like my favourite,
    battered, old novel, thrown to the floor; the ink on the page, so damaged by light
    and touch, begins to fade—the text is no longer black. That path became grey and
    winding, and it suited me: whenever I say, think or do anything, I can always
    see the reverse, and justify the opposite. Perhaps, I thought, I had absorbed
    the entropy of it, the energy of the site itself, to live as the structure, whose
    images faded inside of me. Robert Smithson frequently discussed the idea of energy
    transfer, but there was one comment in particular, upon producing *Glue Pour*
    (1969), which struck a chord with me. He spoke of the decisive event which solidified
    Duchamp’s *The Large Glass* (1915–1923): the cracking of it. During the movement
    of the work from A to B, the work though carefully packaged, famously, shattered
    in transit. Smithson saw Duchamp’s attempt to safely transport the work as being
    an endeavour to overcome entropy; however, against your greatest efforts, it's
    the destiny of glass, to eventually break. He aligned it with the entropy found
    in geology, where everything is gradually worn down. And Smithson felt that in
    association to the art object, and Duchamp too, embraced it, realising his glass
    only became the Large Glass, on experiencing its change into something similar,
    but again, decidedly other. And what they touched upon, I feel is what art is:
    the energy of something, changing into something else.\n<br>\n<br>\nThrough my
    work, I began to realise the materials which made up this ruin, had departed the
    realm of the functional, operational, and in doing so, had entered a world of
    the pure and absolute. Here we could deal with the fundamental nature of things:
    the enduring absence and presence of it, and of us. As it oscillated between the
    two, between life and death, we weren’t witnessing the loss of images, and the
    loss of meaning, rather, the breeding of things, and the presence of the energy
    that is art. The growing, adding, multiplication of things which gave us air to
    fill our lungs, and opposed the habitual reading of photographs: a distillation
    or a crystallisation of things, into minerals, light and time. So the site became
    a paradox for me. At first, I sought to enter a world of obliterated images, the
    end of the image, you could say, and time itself, a void, an abyss, much like
    Klein’s *The Void* (1958), but what precipitated, through traversing the abyss,
    through the image of it, was an action not too dissimilar to Alice falling into
    Wonderland: I learnt a way of feeling which was beyond my apprehension. I guess,
    it was the surreality of it, of learning that which surrounds you, was a clear,
    glass box, the atmosphere of which compresses you, until at last, you were urged
    by your last breath, to reach out, and touch the surface. When you went to touch
    the glass you realised it was not glass at all, but air.\n<br>\n<br>\nI suspect,
    without knowing it, I’ve found myself in the midst of it, in an ever expanding,
    ever turning, spectrum of research. I’ve learnt many others have found a solitude
    in it, lying, comforted, underneath sheets of glass: Derek Jarman, use to literally
    sleep inside a greenhouse in his cold, lofty flat, an emblem of his undying love
    for the botanical, and the distance he felt between his identity and social acceptance;
    Agnès Varda’s piece, *The Greenhouse of Happiness* (2018), was constructed entirely
    out of original 35mm negatives, and mused on the nature of nostalgia, as her work
    underwent a metamorphosis, becoming a literal house of cinema; Maurice Maeterlinck,
    the Belgian playwright, released a book of poems, titled *Hothouses* (1889), which
    delved into the nature of the soul, and the subconscious under glass; and lastly,
    Léon Spilliaert, the symbolist painter, who was greatly influenced by the aforementioned
    writer, became infatuated by their contained atmosphere, filling his depictions
    with a strong brooding colour and subtle luminescence. As many others have before
    me, I shall continue to learn from it.\n<br> \n<br>\n*Falling through;*<br> \n*falling
