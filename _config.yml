description:
  Alexander Mourant is an artist based in London. His practice utilises
  autobiography, literature and reference-based thinking, to create narratives that
  explore the relationship between the body and the photographic medium. He primarily
  draws on methodologies cultivated by the 1960s Land Art Movement, Performance and
  Arte Povera.
