    and was nominated for the Foam Paul Huf Award. Mourant is a member of [Revolv Collective](https://revolv.org.uk), an arts organisation
    established in 2017 which champions art pedagogy; he is also a Contributor at [C4 Journal](https://c4journal.com), a platform dedicated to

    University, and MA Photography at Royal College of Art, London.
    <br>
    <br>
    The work of Alexander Mourant embraces autobiography, literature and reference-based thinking, to create narratives that question the relationship between the body and the photographic medium. His  practice is a deeply rooted investigation into photography, writing, performance and sculpture, and seeks to uncover a parallelism between action and theoretical discourse. Known for his post-conceptual approach and expanded [research](https://www.instagram.com/alexandermourant/), he often utilises methodologies cultivated by the 1960s-70s Land Art movement, Performance and Arte Povera, to help question, or push, our understanding of the photographic. Mourant proposes how images may deal with temporality, spatiality and reflexivity, through new ways of thinking, and alludes to the photographic becoming a terrain itself, and a place we traverse.
