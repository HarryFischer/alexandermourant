His work has been included in publications such as FT Weekend Magazine, British Journal of Photography, Photograph, Unseen Magazine and The Greatest Magazine. Solo shows include Aomori at The Old Truman Brewery and Unseen Amsterdam, alongside group shows at Edel Assanti, Saatchi Gallery and Peckham 24. Mourant is a recipient of grants from ArtHouse Jersey, Jersey Bursary and Arts Council England. He has won the Free Range Award and was nominated for Foam Paul Huf Award.

    In addition to his practice, Alexander Mourant is a Visiting Lecturer and Tutor on BA (Hons) Photography at University of Westminster, he believes passionately in the power of creativity. Recently, in 2022, he designed and led *[A Place to Call Home](https://www.swlondoner.co.uk/news/19032022-artwork-of-wandsworth-schoolchildren-on-show-in-southside-shopping-centre)*, a landmark schools collaboration project with Wandsworth Council’s Children’s and Arts Service. The project saw 2,216 pupils, 123 teachers and 51 schools in the borough of Wandsworth, participate in a series of expanded art sessions, exploring the subject of community. The focal point of *[A Place to Call Home](https://www.instagram.com/p/CarP762svGf/)* took the form of a large architectural installation, built collaboratively with contributions from each class, in the form of a panel artwork. The outcome was a vibrant tapestry, representing the imagination, diversity and social fabric of the community.
