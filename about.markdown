    Mourant is an artist and educator based in London. He is a Lecturer in Photography
    at [Kingston University](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/photography/).
    His forthcoming monograph, *The Night and the First Sculpture*, will be published
    by Folium Books, Autumn 2024. Recent exhibitions include *To Walk in the Image*,
    Lismore Castle Arts, Ireland (2023), *At the Farthest Edge: Rebuilding Photography*,
    NŌUA, Norway (2023) and *A Sudden Vanishing*, Seen Fifteen Gallery, London (2023).
    Mourant is a recipient of grants from Arts Council Norway, Arts Council England
    and ArtHouse Jersey. He has been commissioned by FT Weekend Magazine, Hapax Magazine
    and The Greatest Magazine, and included in BJP, The Guardian, Photograph, Photoworks,
    METAL Magazine and Photomonitor. He won the Free Range Award and was nominated
    for the Foam Paul Huf Award. Mourant is a Member of [Revolv Collective](https://revolv.org.uk)
    and Contributor at [C4 Journal](https://c4journal.com). He achieved BA Photography
    at Falmouth University, and MA Photography at Royal College of Art, London. \n<br>\n<br>\nThe
    work of Alexander Mourant embraces autobiography, literature and reference-based
    thinking, to create narratives that question the relationship between the body
    and the photographic medium. His  practice is a deeply rooted investigation into
    photography, writing, performance and sculpture, and seeks to uncover a parallelism
    between action and theoretical discourse. Known for his post-conceptual approach
    and expanded [research](https://www.instagram.com/alexandermourant/), he often
    utilises methodologies cultivated by the 1960s-70s Land Art movement, Performance
    and Arte Povera, to help question, or push, our understanding of the photographic.
    Mourant proposes how images may deal with temporality, spatiality and reflexivity,
    through new ways of thinking, and alludes to the photographic becoming a terrain
    itself, and a place we traverse."
