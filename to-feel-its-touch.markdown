    Amsterdam 2019, written by Vivienne Gamble, Founder & Director Seen Fifteen Gallery:\n<br>\n<br>\n*Alexander
    Mourant presents a new series of abstract works which respond to the ubiquitous
    cycle of urban renewal and regeneration. To Feel Its Touch began as a commission
    by the Financial Times to make a body of work reflecting the artist’s feelings
    about London and his place within it. On an early morning walk, Mourant was struck
    by the sight of an area \nof the city being excavated and unearthed. A section
    of the city appeared before him as a void, ruptured as if it had an open wound:*\n<br>\n<br>
    \n***“I realised that London is essentially an interwoven lattice of materials
    - combining and dividing - instigating our meeting and plotting our separation.”
    Alexander Mourant***\n<br>\n<br>\n*Inspired by ideas around memory and the city,
    Mourant retraced areas of London he had known during childhood which were now
    undergoing change. Where he found major works he removed some excavated earth
    and took it back to the darkroom.*\n<br>\n<br> \n*Alexander Mourant’s practice
    is concerned with the metaphysical nature of photography. He experiments with
    the photographic process to find new ways to draw attention to and question our
    relationship to our environment. For To Feel Its Touch he created an abstract,
    interconnecting photogram using nine large format negatives. The material from
    the London excavations was suspended in a large tank of water. Taken during one
    exposure, this intensely physical process imbues itself with suggestive qualities
    and personal memory.* - Vivienne Gamble, 2019"
