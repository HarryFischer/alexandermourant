    You make my neck ache.<br>
    You make my arms ache.<br>
    You make my back ache.<br>
    You make my legs ache.<br>
    You make, surprisingly, the arches of my feet ache.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You make aching into a form.<br>
    You make aching hold volume.<br>
    You make aching *move*.<br>
    You make aching cast a shadow.<br>
    You make aching a thing unto itself.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You make aching addicting.<br>
    You make aching pleasing.<br>
    You make aching worrying.<br>
    You make aching gratifying.<br>
    You make aching in a way, I’ve never before ached.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You make me want to suffocate. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    *You* did this.<br>
    *You* make.

  entry-body-text: "I must apologise for yesterday. It is clear to me now, after a
    good night’s sleep, that I was rather agitated. Riled up, as it were. And to tell
    you the truth, I was a little bit nervous. So, as a result, I took my frustration
    out on you. Which I am ashamed of. Truly. I don’t expect it to happen again. But,
    if it does, you must promise to speak plainly, and clearly, as I won’t tolerate
    your dissatisfaction—I don’t want us to drift apart.<br> \n<br>\n<br> \nApart,
    I sigh, before we have even begun. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTo begin is often thought
    to be the hardest part. *Part of what*, you may ask yourself. Well, part of the
    whole. And what is the whole? The whole is something which, I must admit, I am
    still navigating; however, I expect the whole would have a start and an end. But
    again, what defines the start, and what defines the end. Do you? Do I? Do we?
    Who shall we turn to for an answer? For a line, clearly drawn in the sand. You,
    no, *you*; yes, yes *you*; line-up, toes on the line, back straight, shoulders
    back, breathe, I said *breathe*; on your mark, get set, go!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou
    bolt from the line.<br> \nOr does the line bolt from you?<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nThis
    part then, is something difficult to define. And whose to stay it goes in a straight
    line, like our runner, hurtling along the sand. As it happens, this whole I imagine,
    is not straight, but round, like a circle, or a slice of pie. It actually reminds
    me of a diagram, of those tedious fractions which we learnt at school. Those fractions,
    were often three-dimensional, much like our pie. They had depth; their section,
    their part, travelled up, down and through the whole. And this depth is something
    all together unpredictable too—depth grows depth, you see.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI
    sense I have confused the matter.<br> \nI need to stop this frantic energy.<br>
    \n<br>\n<br>\nPerhaps it’s hard to begin, as beginning means roughly understanding
    what this thing is *a part of*: what piece, what fraction, does the beginning
    mean, to its whole? Anyway, you don’t have to answer that right away. Muse on
    it. Absorb it. Drink it all in. We have the time—some would say, all the time
    in the world. And just as the runner returns, to find their line again, we may
    realise that this beginning has been swept away, by an incoming tide.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nI
    guess it’s up to me, to draw the line again. "

  entry-body-text: "Isn’t *apart* a rather odd thing.<br> \nI mean, just look at the
    word itself.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nTo be *apart*, means to be s-e-p-e-r-a-t-e.<br>
    \nBut the word itself remains together.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nWhereas, to be *a part*,
    is to be together: *a part of* something.<br> \nBut the term itself remains s-e-p-e-r-a-t-e.<br>\n<br>
    \n<br>\nWeird, huh?"

    might then be best to say, you are *approaching* here.<br> \nTo reaffirm our position:
    you approach here, from over *there*."

    to go from there.<br>\n<br> \n<br>\nSomehow, instead of you *approaching* me,
    I find myself *reaching* for you.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nI stretch my arm out, open
    my hand, and wave it, as if feeling for a wall in darkness. An act of will, but
    exactly whose will, again, I’m not entirely certain.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI feel an
    immense pressure rise within me.<br>\nMy mouth is dry, my knees, weak.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nI’m

  entry-body-text: "I wonder to myself, whether I should leave you loiter.<br>\nLoitering
    outside, in the rain.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI’m struggling with it.<br>\nWith this
    decision I must make.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI do not suggest that I find your demeanour
    distressing, or even menacing, as if you startle me, by skulking around outside.
    I am not unsettled by your face, or at least, I don’t believe so. I’m undecided.
    I have not yet materialised the face of you. And to do so would be wrong, I think.
    It exists like a crying window, full of distortion and glare. It’s hard for me
    to explain.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWe are close, but far.<br> \nI can hear you mumble
    and murmur.<br>   \n<br>\n<br>\nThe thing is, once I let you in—you’re in. There’s
    no pushing you, our guest, back out into the rain. It’s a one-way ticket. Into
    this warm, cosy room, I call myself. But this self, at the present moment, is
    not quite itself, and you may wish to turn on your heels, and go in search of
    someone else. I give you this warning: go *somewhere* else. There’s a chill in
    here too, the fire is struggling, its embers, lessening. Growing cold. I fear
    to be stamped out.<br>  \n<br>\n<br>\nYou seem to be quite enjoying the rain,
    dripping down your face.<br> \nYou don’t seem too cold either, or discontent.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI
    shall leave you loiter.<br> \nA while longer.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\n*Apart*. "
