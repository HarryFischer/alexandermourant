    You make my neck ache.<br>
    You make my arms ache.<br>
    You make my back ache.<br>
    You make my legs ache.<br>
    You make, surprisingly, the arches of my feet ache.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You make aching into a form.<br>
    You make aching hold volume.<br>
    You make aching *move*.<br>
    You make aching cast a shadow.<br>
    You make aching a thing unto itself.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You make aching addicting.<br>
    You make aching pleasing.<br>
    You make aching worrying.<br>
    You make aching gratifying.<br>
    You make aching in a way, I’ve never before ached.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You make me want to suffocate. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    *You* did this.<br>
    *You* make.

  entry-body-text: "I must apologise for yesterday. It is clear to me now, after a
    good night’s sleep, that I was rather agitated. Riled up, as it were. And to tell
    you the truth, I was a little bit nervous. So, as a result, I took my frustration
    out on you. Which I am ashamed of. Truly. I don’t expect it to happen again. But,
    if it does, you must promise to speak plainly, and clearly, as I won’t tolerate
    your dissatisfaction—I don’t want us to drift apart.<br> \n<br>\n<br> \nApart,
    I sigh, before we have even begun. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTo begin is often thought
    to be the hardest part. *Part of what*, you may ask yourself. Well, part of the
    whole. And what is the whole? The whole is something which, I must admit, I am
    still navigating; however, I expect the whole would have a start and an end. But
    again, what defines the start, and what defines the end. Do you? Do I? Do we?
    Who shall we turn to for an answer? For a line, clearly drawn in the sand. You,
    no, *you*; yes, yes *you*; line-up, toes on the line, back straight, shoulders
    back, breathe, I said *breathe*; on your mark, get set, go!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou
    bolt from the line.<br> \nOr does the line bolt from you?<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nThis
    part then, is something difficult to define. And whose to stay it goes in a straight
    line, like our runner, hurtling along the sand. As it happens, this whole I imagine,
    is not straight, but round, like a circle, or a slice of pie. It actually reminds
    me of a diagram, of those tedious fractions which we learnt at school. Those fractions,
    were often three-dimensional, much like our pie. They had depth; their section,
    their part, travelled up, down and through the whole. And this depth is something
    all together unpredictable too—depth grows depth, you see.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI
    sense I have confused the matter.<br> \nI need to stop this frantic energy.<br>
    \n<br>\n<br>\nPerhaps it’s hard to begin, as beginning means roughly understanding
    what this thing is *a part of*: what piece, what fraction, does the beginning
    mean, to its whole? Anyway, you don’t have to answer that right away. Muse on
    it. Absorb it. Drink it all in. We have the time—some would say, all the time
    in the world. And just as the runner returns, to find their line again, we may
    realise that this beginning has been swept away, by an incoming tide.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nI
    guess it’s up to me, to draw the line again. "

  entry-body-text: "Isn’t *apart* a rather odd thing.<br> \nI mean, just look at the
    word itself.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nTo be *apart*, means to be s-e-p-e-r-a-t-e.<br>
    \nBut the word itself remains together.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nWhereas, to be *a part*,
    is to be together: *a part of* something.<br> \nBut the term itself remains s-e-p-e-r-a-t-e.<br>\n<br>
    \n<br>\nWeird, huh?"
