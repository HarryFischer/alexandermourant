    You make my neck ache.<br>
    You make my arms ache.<br>
    You make my back ache.<br>
    You make my legs ache.<br>
    You make, surprisingly, the arches of my feet ache.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You make aching into a form.<br>
    You make aching hold volume.<br>
    You make aching *move*.<br>
    You make aching cast a shadow.<br>
    You make aching a thing unto itself.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You make aching addicting.<br>
    You make aching pleasing.<br>
    You make aching worrying.<br>
    You make aching gratifying.<br>
    You make aching in a way, I’ve never before ached.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You make me want to suffocate. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    *You* did this.<br>
    *You* make.

  entry-body-text: "I must apologise for yesterday. It is clear to me now, after a
    good night’s sleep, that I was rather agitated. Riled up, as it were. And to tell
    you the truth, I was a little bit nervous. So, as a result, I took my frustration
    out on you. Which I am ashamed of. Truly. I don’t expect it to happen again. But,
    if it does, you must promise to speak plainly, and clearly, as I won’t tolerate
    your dissatisfaction—I don’t want us to drift apart.<br> \n<br>\n<br> \nApart,
    I sigh, before we have even begun. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTo begin is often thought
    to be the hardest part. *Part of what*, you may ask yourself. Well, part of the
    whole. And what is the whole? The whole is something which, I must admit, I am
    still navigating; however, I expect the whole would have a start and an end. But
    again, what defines the start, and what defines the end. Do you? Do I? Do we?
    Who shall we turn to for an answer? For a line, clearly drawn in the sand. You,
    no, *you*; yes, yes *you*; line-up, toes on the line, back straight, shoulders
    back, breathe, I said *breathe*; on your mark, get set, go!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou
    bolt from the line.<br> \nOr does the line bolt from you?<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nThis
    part then, is something difficult to define. And whose to stay it goes in a straight
    line, like our runner, hurtling along the sand. As it happens, this whole I imagine,
    is not straight, but round, like a circle, or a slice of pie. It actually reminds
    me of a diagram, of those tedious fractions which we learnt at school. Those fractions,
    were often three-dimensional, much like our pie. They had depth; their section,
    their part, travelled up, down and through the whole. And this depth is something
    all together unpredictable too—depth grows depth, you see.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI
    sense I have confused the matter.<br> \nI need to stop this frantic energy.<br>
    \n<br>\n<br>\nPerhaps it’s hard to begin, as beginning means roughly understanding
    what this thing is *a part of*: what piece, what fraction, does the beginning
    mean, to its whole? Anyway, you don’t have to answer that right away. Muse on
    it. Absorb it. Drink it all in. We have the time—some would say, all the time
    in the world. And just as the runner returns, to find their line again, we may
    realise that this beginning has been swept away, by an incoming tide.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nI
    guess it’s up to me, to draw the line again. "

    word itself.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nTo be *apart*, means to be s-e-p-e-r-a-t-e.<br>
    \nBut the word itself remains together.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nWhereas, to be *a part*,
    is to be together: *a part of* something. But the term itself remains s-e-p-e-r-a-t-e.<br>\n<br>

    outside, in the rain.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI’m struggling with it.<br>\nWith this
    decision I must make.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI do not suggest that I find your demeanour
    distressing, or even menacing, as if you startle me, by skulking around outside.
    I am not unsettled by your face, or at least, I don’t believe so. I’m undecided.
    I have not yet materialised the face of you. And to do so would be wrong, I think.
    It exists like a crying window, full of distortion and glare. It’s hard for me
    to explain.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWe are close, but far.<br> \nI can hear you mumble
    and murmur.<br>   \n<br>\nThe thing is, once I let you in—you’re in. There’s no
    pushing you, our guest, back out into the rain. It’s a one-way ticket. Into this
    warm, cosy room, I call myself. But this self, at the present moment, is not quite
    itself, and you may wish to turn on your heels, and go in search of someone else.
    I give you this warning: go *somewhere* else. There’s a chill in here too, the
    fire is struggling, its embers, lessening. Growing cold. I fear to be stamped
    out.<br>  \n<br>\nYou seem to be quite enjoying the rain, dripping down your face.
    You don’t seem too cold either, or discontent.\n<br>\n<br>\nI shall leave you

  entry-body-text: "And so my plan is revealed. My intention, laid bare, albeit, only
    to a certain extent; we still have far to go together; many miles and many pages
    to cover. Up until now, I hope you haven’t found them too convoluted, my stories
    and tales I mean. I wasn’t aware of how ambiguous you wished it; how subtle, how
    direct, how *within* itself you wanted it. I think as we negotiate what *it is*,
    we shall fluctuate from within to outside ourselves. Oscillating between the two.
    Like air, drawn into my lungs, and blown back out.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI am relieved
    to start discussing what planting meant to me.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou see, we had
    chosen the field months prior; selecting it, out of numerous others. It had to
    be right. It had to *feel* right. And so we debated, and eventually whittled them
    down, like you would a block of wood, to find the perfect shape. We settled on
    our preferred choice and waited. Then, after a couple weeks flew by, we attempted
    to commence the process: to start planting the field. But, for some reason, you
    felt it not right, and sent the weather to hold us off; the rain poured, and poured,
    and the sun didn’t shine; I waited two weeks but you never let up. The soil was
    waterlogged. I was downcast, irritated and impatient. My concern was this: if
    not now, then when? I felt you were attempting to elude me, as if I was a stranger,
    following you down a dark, sinister street at night. And so you made me wait,
    and I waited and wondered, each and every day.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nAfter six weeks,
    you changed your mood. The weather lifted and we began to commence for a second
    time. I was dubious, to say the least, unkeen to set myself up for another fall.
    But the day came, I arrived, parked, and walked into the field. The sun was bright,
    the sky was blue, and the earth, the earth was moist—it was just right. The field
    was unkempt; the grass, luscious, and a vivid green. The stage was set, so to
    speak, and we began.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nFirst, I watched as my dad, cut the grass.
    He started from the edge, and made his way up and down the field, slashing at
    the lengths. Very quickly, variations of shade, colour and tone appeared in the
    field, along the lengths of grass already cut. They contrasted with each other,
    depending on the direction of the cut and your position. I walked up the side
    of the bank, and observed as the final strip was sliced, clean off; separating
    the image I knew, from its former, unkempt self, to a newer, fresher face. Appearances
    shifted, like quicksand.<br>\n<br> \n<br>\nThe process did not stop there: next
    came a breaking, as the rotavator swept the ground, removing what little carpet
    of green was left. Uprooted entirely, and giving way to a light brown, dry soil,
    I felt as if we were grinding pigment in a pestle and mortar. The canvas too,
    was being stretched and defined, its dimensions becoming clear. I’ll forgive you
    for thinking that the boundaries of this task were a comforting sight. It is true,
    knowing the distance you must travel, does indeed help support your confidence
    in the journey. But here, here the distance was to the horizon, and I could not
    see to the other side. My body was confronted, with the scale of it, with its
    own minuscule nature against the expansive, devouring space of the field. I stood
    face-to-face with it, trembling."

  entry-body-text: "The following day, I returned to the field.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nToday
    we were to plough.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nThe ploughman arrived. I observed a great,
    curved, metallic toothed monster, following behind him. I spoke to him briefly,
    before he set off. He seemed confident he’d make short work of it. The plough
    dug into the ground, penetrated it, and dragged. The tractor at first jolted,
    digging in, pulled back slightly by the unrelenting grip of the soil, it was hard,
    solid, iron-willed too. But alas, it gave itself up, and the ploughman started
    his way up the field, carving the soil. Turning it over, and over, and over. *I
    could recall the soil very well, how dark it was and the smell of it—as if it
    had never before been opened up. The scent was like a forest of trees, ground
    up, layered and squeezed together*. It was like time itself had released an aroma.
    Watching soil, deep, nutrient rich soil, being summoned from the ground, was like
    seeing waves appear, when the ocean was nowhere near. It gives you a sense of
    something essential, or fundamental, when you’re near it, as if the balance of
    the universe relies on it.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nTumbling, tumbling, tumbling.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe
    plough, in its wake, formed a landscape within a landscape. A thousand landscapes.
    The slopes and jagged edges shimmered. Angle, surface, texture, size, scale, depth,
    width, height and length, all paraded in front of me. I felt a sense of vertigo
    from the infinite. Perspectives bred like rabbits in the hedgerows. And it was
    then, I formed the realisation of what the world is made of: earth. I saw what
    God must have, when forming tectonic plates, and compressing them together, to
    force a surge, an uplift, of boundless energy. An endless mountain range appeared
    before me. And I fell before it, onto my knees. It multiplied inside of me and
    I inside it.<br>\n<br>\n<br> \nCrumbling, crumbling, crumbling.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nAs
    the ploughman progressed on, field turned into battlefield. The enemy approached
    from the western flank. I arrived in fallen worlds, only to stagger, clumsily,
    into another. My feet were alien to me. I pressed on. The sun in my eyes, sweat
    at my brow and a pounding in my chest. I felt a kind of catharsis in seeing something
    ravaged other than myself. These craters, these edges, extended out of me. And
    to move through them, was as if to come to terms with them, to map them, inside
    myself. *Art is like the traces of wounds ploughed into the field*. Ploughing
    reveals more than it hides. It digs up the root of things. It mixes in, parts
    of me, reached by light, and those untouched by it. The field eats itself. To
    produce from itself. You fuel yourself in ways unknown to yourself.<br>\n<br>
    \n<br>\nI waved goodbye to the ploughman, as he left, for another field.<br>\n<br>
    \n<br>\nA job well done."

  entry-body-text: "The field was being realised, ever so quickly, in front of my
    eyes.<br>\n<br> \n<br>\nOnce I triggered the start, every stage seemed to be upon
    me.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nThe fertiliser rained down, like hail stones. Little white
    pellets of sustenance and energy, scattered: left, right, up, down. They filled
    the air and settled on the soil. Slipping into every crack and crevice produced
    by the plough. I thought it would take as long as the other work, but then the
    driver, promptly positioned himself in the middle of the field, fired up the machine,
    and commenced; within two minutes, the work was done. I was surprised at the speed
    of it, at the efficiency of the process. I merely blinked and he was gone.<br>\n<br>
    \n<br>\nWe called for the power harrow, and soon enough, within an hour or so,
    it came billowing up the lane. I thought this machine similar to the rotavator,
    but it was heavier, stronger, with far more brute force. It started, like the
    others, by travelling up and down, moving right to left. It sounded like a high
    pitched wail, escalating, as the circular drum with blades spun, gaining increased
    velocity. A pummelling. A battering. It crushed and compounded. Ushering in, wherever
    it went, a uniformity. It levelled the earth. My sea of mountains became a mill
    pond, gently undulating. Behind the machine, from the right angle, you could see
    these cliff like edges being funnelled in. After, I was left with a smooth layer
    of finely prepared soil. I ran my fingers through it.<br>\n<br> \n<br>\nAs we
    were pressed for time, they sent the crawler out too, whilst the rotavator was
    still completing the remaining half of the field. The crawler is a funny, little,
    yellow, aged machine. I remember it from when I was a boy. Over the years its
    parts have been removed, adjusted, fixed or replaced entirely. So much so, I wasn’t
    completely sure if I was looking at the same machine, or a patchwork, made of
    metal. And as its name suggests, it is a thing that crawls, on caterpillar tracks,
    thereby moving at a slower pace than most. It gave me a sense of something prehistoric,
    unleashed from a cage, as it groaned its way up the field. The crawler is tasked
    with directing the soil, balancing the flow, to create perfectly proportioned
    rows, or furrows, as they are known in the trade. These span the length of the
    field in parallel lines. These too induce vertigo, from a ceaseless progression,
    of up and down.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nTo observe both machines move around each other,
    on the same stage, was like watching a carefully choreographed dance, between
    two people. They sped up, they slowed down, they moved over, around and across
    each other. Each added to the other’s work, to the other’s movement. They pushed
    forward, together, and before long, the field was done, prepared, ready for another’s
    entrance.<br>\n<br> \n<br>\nFor the final act, they brought a tractor and a trailer,
    carrying boxes of seed for me to plant. Thankfully, they placed these boxes along
    the furrows, at intervals twenty meters apart, to help my progression, along the
    field. I thanked them and they departed. They seemed to laugh between themselves,
    again, in disbelief. I was at last alone with no more distractions and no more
    observations. The task now fell to me, onto my shoulders."

  entry-body-text: I am tempted to continue, to continue speaking like I have, over
    the past few days. But I think describing how I *did this*, or how I *did that*,
    may get slightly tiresome, for both you, to read, and I, to write. I also feel
    we’ve reached a point in this narrative, a juncture, where an attempt to convey,
    or interpret the nature of my planting, in its entirety, would be futile. I’ve
    learnt there are a few things beyond the reach of language, and this, in fact,
    might be one of them. Furthermore, somethings, after all, must be kept for myself.
    And so, rather than trying to climb a slippery, muddy slope, I shall merely stand
    at the bottom, and observe one or two things which crossed my path.

    the *lack of* sensation. I had spent my first day in the field planting by hand.

    had committed myself, in body and mind, to the task at hand. I was planting as
    directed, up and down the furrows. The phrase *back-breaking* is often bandied
    about nowadays, but truly, I speak from a place of experience, it was indeed,
    *back-breaking*. I continued on, completed twelve rows, and headed home. I was
    exhausted. Spent. For the remainder of the evening, I was incapable of moving;
    my muscles ached, throbbed, burned, and at times were agonising and tender. I
    positioned myself in bed, moaned as I lay my body flat, and attempted to go to
    sleep. I felt my blood rush around my body and heat radiated out from me.<br>\n<br>\nAs
    I lay there, willing myself to sleep, dreading the following day, I noticed I
    could feel the weight of my body, more than ever before. *The body declares itself
    subject!* It made itself known to me, as an object, one with its own limits, boundaries
    and intentions. It had been thrown, you could say, by me, the pilot, into a nosedive,
    hurtling towards the ocean. It was alarmed, and alert. I realised then, it’s not
    normally one for my attention. I guess, I use it, without really considering it.
    When I was there, contemplating this new found *knowing* of myself, I located
    a place I could not feel, it was numb, and cold to touch. My left hand—to be precise,
    the right side, of my left palm—did not ache; truth be told, it did not feel anything
    at all. I squeezed and massaged it with the fingers from my other hand. It was
    lifeless. I had a strange sense of doubleness wash over me, of slippage: that
    feeling which occurs when your brain stumbles, trips over itself, unable to discern
    what it thinks it knows, from what it feels.<br>\n<br>\nI ascertained that there,
    here, that padded piece of flesh, was where my weight rested, when traversing
    the field. I learnt that, to plant properly, you must hold the box with either
    your left or right hand; and instead of carrying the full weight of the box, constantly,
    you must channel your weight; support it, when bent down, through your hand, arm
    and shoulder; by doing so, you help support your back. Once your back goes, you
    go.<br>\n<br>\nThe human hand is commonly known as a grasping organ; it is so
    familiar, and so essential, we often overlook its importance. Its meaning can
    range across a variety of subjects too: *in the hands of*, implies the holding
    of power, wealth and authority; *a helping hand*, suggests the giving of assistance,
    aid and support; *a big hand*, often leads to applause, praise and adoration;
    *to hand off*, is to offload, or relinquish responsibility; *show your hand*,
    leads to the revealing of not only cards, but intent; *by my hand*, is literally,
    made by my hand (handwriting); *a hand*, is four inches, and a unit for measuring
    the height of a horse; *may I ask for your hand in*, is of course, marriage; and
    finally, although I’m sure there are many more, *a hand*, is a sailor in a ship’s
    crew, and by association, a labourer. This odyssey of meaning brought me to the
    word *manual*, which comes from the latin *manus*, meaning *hand*; and so, we
    arrive at *manual labour*, and everything, by extension, that uses a *hand* and
    the body.<br>\n<br>\nAs those thoughts whirled around my mind, I began to drift.
    You know, *often, before having the courage to go toward the greatness of sleep,
    I pretend that someone is holding my hand and I go, go toward the enormous absence
    of form that is sleep. And when even then I can’t find the courage, then I dream.*
    In your hands, you carry me. "

  entry-body-text: "My second observation, was that of rhythm. It’s an interesting
    question, isn’t it: *how to move?* A few weeks ago, I found I had to learn how
    to travel over the earth, in a way unfamiliar to myself, but not too dissimilar
    to a rock climber, ascending a cliff face: grappling with the surface, weight
    forward, constantly in motion, building momentum and crucially, *never looking
    back*. I was, of course, moving horizontally, but I had a strong suspicion that
    the surface, and the direction of my passing, defied one another, just as though
    they knew our relationship was out of whack, unnatural, much like a climber, five
    hundred meters high, hanging on by their fingertips.<br> \n<br>\nOut of place.<br>

  entry-body-text: "As I traversed the field, diligently planting, what I thought
    I knew annulled itself.<br>\n<br> \n<br> \nIt stirred and revealed itself to me,
    as I shall now reveal it to you.<br> \n<br>\n<br> \nI realised that rhythm is
    one of the hardest things to learn, and one of the hardest things to gain. You
    see, I was never much of a dancer, or a musician, or a sportsman. I was never
    much of anything. And I’d be lying if I didn’t somewhat resent myself for that.
    They say you are born with rhythm. They say you are born with or without it. It
    is just one of those things, one of those many, many things, which we add to our
    long list of things we choose to live by; preordained, predestined shackles, heavy
    around our limbs. *Me? No. No, I can’t dance*. I never have. And I kind of always
    felt, if I did have it, I wouldn’t know where to place it. *Take your good intentions
    elsewhere*. Climatically: to gain rhythm is actually, to gain acceptance; to be
    rhythmic, is to know yourself.<br>\n<br>\n<br> \nI now suspect it, rhythm that
    is, as something extending out, and proliferating the world around us. Hidden
    behind shadows, doorways, laying under the earth. It appears like low lying mist,
    in the early morning air, the weight of gravity holding it down, making it *a
    part of* this world; it is so precious, so unique, it would depart us, should
    it get the chance. A flutter of golden butterflies. A splash of light. A breath
    as deep as the sea. You find rhythm in more ways than you know. In the words I
    use to write to you. And in the sentences I cobble together. I feel, sometimes,
    like I dance through letters and words. They carry us through the rhythm of the
    page. Much like music, building, growing, successively following itself, existing
    *in* and *through* time, the effects of which are at the mercy of experience and
    duration. I think I’ve found it. And I now point you towards the essence of music,
    dance, sport, and writing, as I now know it, and dare I say it, life, which I
    feel, deeply, in my heart: *rhythm*.<br> \n<br>\n<br> \n*Oh honey*, put on your
    dancing shoes.<br> \nLet’s hit the town.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nRhythm,<br>\nburied
    with me,<br> \ns<br>\ne<br>\ne<br>\np<br>\ns<br>\nout of me,<br> \ninto the ground.<br>
    \n<br>\nFuelling,<br>\nspinning the Earth.<br>"

  entry-body-text: "I held the stone and it held my gaze. I moved it around in my
    palm, spinning it, overturning it, tracing and recording every inch of its surface;
    I noted its shape, dimension, colour and outline against my palm. By all appearances,
    it seemed ordinary. Ordinary like the rest. Ordinary like a stone. And much like
    the others, that had passed through my hand, it was smooth, greyish, dirty in
    places, and cold, cold to touch. But somehow, this one appeared different to the
    rest; it was *out of the ordinary*. Wherever the ordinary was, it had emerged
    from it.<br>\n<br>\nIt was heavier somehow. Heavier.<br>\nOr was it lighter? Lighter.<br>\n<br>\nI
    glanced back, back over my shoulder, to see a line of stones following me to where
    I stood. Their length was far, their width, narrow. I felt like a celestial body,
    as constellations of orbs, of stones, circled and circled, orbiting around me.
    They grew, gargantuan, like snowballs, running down a great snowy hill. They lifted
    off and departed this world. It was then I became a stargazer, observing clusters
    of them, of stars, of stones, millions and millions of miles away; flickering,
    glinting, twinkling, their luminescence was sent back to Earth; they penetrated
    the atmosphere, and entered me. I was filled by their message and it was their
    message I did hear: they had come to *lift* me. And so, without hesitation, I
    went, beginning slow at first, but levitating nonetheless. I disobeyed gravity.
    Drifting far and drifting wide. Rolls reversed. Positions eroded. Now, it was
    I, orbiting the stones.<br>\n<br>\n*My stones are like grains of sand in the space
    of the landscape*, I thought, as I soared and soared, high above. They were almost
    amorphous, transmuting themselves. If I’d looked away I would have lost sight
    of them. Perhaps, *my talent as an artist is to walk across a moor, or place a
    stone on the ground*. That would be a noble, simple life: I  dreamt it, I believed
    it, I lived it, and it was done. Milestones are like chapters, spinning out from
    underneath me. Let’s be pragmatic about this. *A precise thought, logical, crystalline
    like the material of the stone*. A stone is a stone is a stone. Much like *a waterfall
    is a waterfall is a waterfall*. Is a stone just the idea of stone? There are parts
    of me, and parts of you, which become, parts of *us*. I gasp. I was mortally open,
    filled with groundlessness. I sensed my own finitude. A crack in reality had sent
    me into a spiral; the spiral begins, the spiral ends, the rest is a curve, much
    like a stone. I did not wish to depart this world *without you*. I struggled,
    kicked and cried, to turn the tide of my momentum. I wanted to return; to return
    to the field, and to you.<br>\n<br>\nI was brought crashing, crashing like a meteor,
    back down to Earth.<br>I snapped back inside myself, and *dropped* the stone.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t|<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t|<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t|<br>\t\t\t\t\t|<br>\t\t\t\t\t|<br>\t\t\t\t\tIt
    landed, with a thud.<br> \t\t\tIndenting the earth. "

  entry-body-text: 'The eyes of the stone stared back at me. I could not plant it,
    I sensed that, deep in my gut. It was a ringleader and it would intoxicate the
    others. It seduced me. What’s more, I had an overwhelming urge to walk; to walk
    *with* it. And so I bent down, picked it up and placed the stone into my pocket.
    I gathered myself, and collected those little pieces of cosmic dust that had ricocheted
    around me. I calmed myself—*deep, deep breaths*—and began to walk.  I took this
    route: straight on, out of the field, and into the lane; left, along the lane
    until I got to the T-junction; right, down into the valley, past the duck pond,
    and then up the hill, back out of the valley; right again, and onto the main road,
    I travelled along here for a while, passing the garden centre, passing the petrol
    station, passing the shop, *what a lovely day for a walk*; I shot a left, following
    the winding lane as it moved like a snake along a forest floor; I stumbled down
    into another valley, and immediately, headed straight back up, my legs burning
    from the height of it; next I went along the lane, until I met the greenhouses,
    and stopped, on the yellow line; right, past St John’s manor; left, down that
    grand boulevard of trees; I continued on, passing the occasional house, and farmland;
    after some time, I arrived at St Mary’s village, walked past the pub and the church,
    and pushed on; this is when I almost lost sight of it: why I was walking; devouring
    trees, devouring leaves, like air; *I like the simplicity of walking, the simplicity
    of stones*, I murmured to myself, as if trying to convince myself to continue
    walking; I did not deviate from my route, I persisted with it, along the same
    road, past the windmill, and then the road took a sharp right; I stared at the
    pavement, hypnotised, watching my feet, and my shoes, march on, as if they were
    possessed; *a walk is just one more layer, a mark, laid upon the thousands of
    other layers of human and geographic history on the surface of the land*; I considered
    my mark, and whether a mark was necessary, *mark my words*, you said to me; I
    took another right, so many, many rights, and eventually arrived at another yellow
    line, I waited, paused for the traffic, and travelled over the road and into the
    lane; I passed the pink house, and then I past Gran’s house, I poked my head around
    the gate, but she wasn’t in; her garden looked tranquil, sheltered and serene;
    whereas, on the lane, the vegetation looked barren, beaten and weathered by this
    stormy position; I felt that stone in my pocket, bouncing against my thigh, a
    tinge of sadness spread from my leg, and up into my heart; *walking presupposes
    that at every step the world changes in some aspect and also that something changes
    in us*; uncertain, my intent wavering, I became like that old tree, *over there*,
    creaking in the wind; at last, the road ebbed and flowed its way to a sweeping
    vista, overlooking the sea, and I emerged, high above the shore, on a cliff face;
    the air was fresh, and I filled my lungs; I followed the twisting, looping, bending
    road down to the beach at L’Etacq, and took the coastal path across the bay, along
    the sea wall; the curve carried me a great distance; the waves rolled in, and
    rolled out, as if pushing and pulling at my body; it was as though, I wandered,
    in and out of consciousness; I lost my balance, and was carried close to the edge
    of the wall; I peered at it, teetering on the brink, tempted to succumb to the
    vastness, to the sublime terror of height; I no longer sought to contain myself;
    my body demanded a metamorphosis, to transcend, to escape itself; my grip on the
    present and the past slipped away, time departed; my thoughts were flooded; the
    waves crashed, pounded, against the wall; I felt it, as if you were banging on
    my skull, cracking my head, like a stone in two; I stumbled on, and at times crawled,
    scraping my knees, cutting them, on the rough concrete; *blood out of a stone*;
    as I staggered to my feet, on my left, the white house floated by; the seagulls
    cawed, following me like scavengers, picking at the weak; the sun was bright,
    a bright, white light, and the swell shimmered and barrelled; exploding stars
    in its wake; I was nearing my end; I was nearing the slipway at Le Braye; words
    carried me the rest of the way. A thought enclosed in a stone.'

    I reached it, not *it*.... don’t be foolish, not you, but something else; I jumped off the wall, onto the granite slipway, kicked off my shoes and removed my socks; I stepped off, my feet touched the sand, and it spread between my toes. The sound of the waves gently crashed as I walked further out onto the beach. A sense of relief pervaded and comforted me. *I felt that I could swim for miles, out into the ocean: a desire for freedom, an impulsive to move, tugged at me as though it were a thread fastened to my chest*. I released myself and sang a melody, it rose and fell, like light, dancing across the waves. *A spirit filled him, pure as the purest water, sweet as dew, moving as music*. As my song moved through the air, I scanned the horizon and noticed a figure, a lone figure, moving frantically along the shoreline. It was, alas, our runner, circling, searching for a line. A line in the sand. The line I had promised him. I was disheartened to see this, to see his madness creeping in; he should have begun, many pages and pages ago. I thought, perhaps, he may have lost sight of himself. It’s easy to do so, as you know. Especially in a place such as this: an abyss of sand; an abyss of you. I need not tell you what happens when you gaze at it.<br>
    <br>
    I placed my hand into my pocket, grasped the stone, and lifted it out. When does a stone become a pebble? When does a mountain become a hill? It was slightly lighter than before. Our walk may have resolved it somewhat, but the stone trembled in fear, it was like an earthquake, the size of my palm. The trembling became an image, or rather, a fragment of *it*; it dug in, sunk its roots down, and burrowed into me; my soul separated itself from my skin, outraged, that an image had replaced it. The stone gave birth to the present. And it is the here and now where we find ourselves. I thought about throwing it at the rocks, catapulting it, to see it land, with a clap, and a thunder. Could I destroy this image; shattering it, into a thousand pieces? Does it have a fossil inside? A fossilised event, like a book, or a poem. I hesitated; I could not destroy a book, no more than I could destroy a person.<br>
    <br>
    I wondered if the stone could grow into a tree of coral under the sea. A beautiful, kaleidoscopic world, a world where mirage becomes reality, where sight itself is not as distinct as it ought to be. I walked a little further, down to the water’s edge. The tension between me and the water grew, closer. I waited and as the wave broke, the sea came rushing up to greet me, like an old friend, long separated by time. What is the sea, the ocean, if not a giant basin of rock, an expansive network of shelves, surfaces, holding the water above it, in its hands or on its shoulders. I saw life made up of material, such as words, which I harness, alongside stone and water; permeating, spreading, or holding on, and standing firm. *Breathing the air of the sea is like breathing the light*. A clarity as fresh as the day. I was tempted to drop you in, to make you *a part of* the sea of stone. You’d be a drop, a drop in the ocean of stories. And maybe, that was that; these stones are like tales, whispers in the wind, departures, waiting to be nurtured and dropped into a melting pot of that which makes you. They are the things which direct, lead, and help you arrive. Like a blustery day, and a sail full of breeze.<br>
    <br>
    The sun began to fall, the light, with it, and so the world did too, falling, falling around us. You were not an ordinary stone after all, but a curious one, from a family of living stones. I bent down, with the stone in my hand and drew a line, a line clear as crystal, unmistakeable, along the sand. The runner looked relieved, thanked me,  from the bottom of his heart, and went on his way. I placed you back into my pocket, turned, and headed home. *A living stone*, I sang and sang. The stone and sea merged together and became me. A body of sea and stone.
