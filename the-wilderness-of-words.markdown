    You make my neck ache.<br>
    You make my arms ache.<br>
    You make my back ache.<br>
    You make my legs ache.<br>
    You make, surprisingly, the arches of my feet ache.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You make aching into a form.<br>
    You make aching hold volume.<br>
    You make aching *move*.<br>
    You make aching cast a shadow.<br>
    You make aching a thing unto itself.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You make aching addicting.<br>
    You make aching pleasing.<br>
    You make aching worrying.<br>
    You make aching gratifying.<br>
    You make aching in a way, Iâ€™ve never before ached.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You make me want to suffocate. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    *You* did this.<br>
    *You* make.
