    You make my neck ache.<br>
    You make my arms ache.<br>
    You make my back ache.<br>
    You make my legs ache.<br>
    You make, surprisingly, the arches of my feet ache.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You make aching into a form.<br>
    You make aching hold volume.<br>
    You make aching *move*.<br>
    You make aching cast a shadow.<br>
    You make aching a thing unto itself.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You make aching addicting.<br>
    You make aching pleasing.<br>
    You make aching worrying.<br>
    You make aching gratifying.<br>
    You make aching in a way, I’ve never before ached.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You make me want to suffocate. <br>
    <br>

    *You* did this.<br>
    *You* make.

  entry-body-text: "I must apologise for yesterday. It is clear to me now, after a
    good night’s sleep, that I was rather agitated. Riled up, as it were. And to tell
    you the truth, I was a little bit nervous. So, as a result, I took my frustration
    out on you. Which I am ashamed of. Truly. I don’t expect it to happen again. But,
    if it does, you must promise to speak plainly, and clearly, as I won’t tolerate
    your dissatisfaction—I don’t want us to drift apart.<br> \n<br>\n<br> \nApart,
    I sigh, before we have even begun. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTo begin is often thought
    to be the hardest part. *Part of what*, you may ask yourself. Well, part of the
    whole. And what is the whole? The whole is something which, I must admit, I am
    still navigating; however, I expect the whole would have a start and an end. But
    again, what defines the start, and what defines the end. Do you? Do I? Do we?
    Who shall we turn to for an answer? For a line, clearly drawn in the sand. You,
    no, *you*; yes, yes *you*; line-up, toes on the line, back straight, shoulders
    back, breathe, I said *breathe*; on your mark, get set, go!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou
    bolt from the line.<br> \nOr does the line bolt from you?<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nThis
    part then, is something difficult to define. And whose to stay it goes in a straight
    line, like our runner, hurtling along the sand. As it happens, this whole I imagine,
    is not straight, but round, like a circle, or a slice of pie. It actually reminds
    me of a diagram, of those tedious fractions which we learnt at school. Those fractions,
    were often three-dimensional, much like our pie. They had depth; their section,
    their part, travelled up, down and through the whole. And this depth is something
    all together unpredictable too—depth grows depth, you see.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI
    sense I have confused the matter.<br> \nI need to stop this frantic energy.<br>
    \n<br>\n<br>\nPerhaps it’s hard to begin, as beginning means roughly understanding
    what this thing is *a part of*: what piece, what fraction, does the beginning
    mean, to its whole? Anyway, you don’t have to answer that right away. Muse on
    it. Absorb it. Drink it all in. We have the time—some would say, all the time
    in the world. And just as the runner returns, to find their line again, we may
    realise that this beginning has been swept away, by an incoming tide.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nI
    guess it’s up to me, to draw the line again. "

    word itself.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nTo be *apart*, means to be s-e-p-e-r-a-t-e.<br>
    \nBut the word itself remains together.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nWhereas, to be *a part*,
    is to be together: *a part of* something. But the term itself remains s-e-p-e-r-a-t-e.<br>\n<br>

    outside, in the rain.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI’m struggling with it.<br>\nWith this
    decision I must make.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI do not suggest that I find your demeanour
    distressing, or even menacing, as if you startle me, by skulking around outside.
    I am not unsettled by your face, or at least, I don’t believe so. I’m undecided.
    I have not yet materialised the face of you. And to do so would be wrong, I think.
    It exists like a crying window, full of distortion and glare. It’s hard for me
    to explain.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWe are close, but far.<br> \nI can hear you mumble
    and murmur.<br>   \n<br>\nThe thing is, once I let you in—you’re in. There’s no
    pushing you, our guest, back out into the rain. It’s a one-way ticket. Into this
    warm, cosy room, I call myself. But this self, at the present moment, is not quite
    itself, and you may wish to turn on your heels, and go in search of someone else.
    I give you this warning: go *somewhere* else. There’s a chill in here too, the
    fire is struggling, its embers, lessening. Growing cold. I fear to be stamped
    out.<br>  \n<br>\nYou seem to be quite enjoying the rain, dripping down your face.
    You don’t seem too cold either, or discontent.\n<br>\n<br>\nI shall leave you

  entry-body-text: "And so my plan is revealed. My intention, laid bare, albeit, only
    to a certain extent; we still have far to go together; many miles and many pages
    to cover. Up until now, I hope you haven’t found them too convoluted, my stories
    and tales I mean. I wasn’t aware of how ambiguous you wished it; how subtle, how
    direct, how *within* itself you wanted it. I think as we negotiate what *it is*,
    we shall fluctuate from within to outside ourselves. Oscillating between the two.
    Like air, drawn into my lungs, and blown back out.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI am relieved
    to start discussing what planting meant to me.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou see, we had
    chosen the field months prior; selecting it, out of numerous others. It had to
    be right. It had to *feel* right. And so we debated, and eventually whittled them
    down, like you would a block of wood, to find the perfect shape. We settled on
    our preferred choice and waited. Then, after a couple weeks flew by, we attempted
    to commence the process: to start planting the field. But, for some reason, you
    felt it not right, and sent the weather to hold us off; the rain poured, and poured,
    and the sun didn’t shine; I waited two weeks but you never let up. The soil was
    waterlogged. I was downcast, irritated and impatient. My concern was this: if
    not now, then when? I felt you were attempting to elude me, as if I was a stranger,
    following you down a dark, sinister street at night. And so you made me wait,
    and I waited and wondered, each and every day.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nAfter six weeks,
    you changed your mood. The weather lifted and we began to commence for a second
    time. I was dubious, to say the least, unkeen to set myself up for another fall.
    But the day came, I arrived, parked, and walked into the field. The sun was bright,
    the sky was blue, and the earth, the earth was moist—it was just right. The field
    was unkempt; the grass, luscious, and a vivid green. The stage was set, so to
    speak, and we began.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nFirst, I watched as my dad, cut the grass.
    He started from the edge, and made his way up and down the field, slashing at
    the lengths. Very quickly, variations of shade, colour and tone appeared in the
    field, along the lengths of grass already cut. They contrasted with each other,
    depending on the direction of the cut and your position. I walked up the side
    of the bank, and observed as the final strip was sliced, clean off; separating
    the image I knew, from its former, unkempt self, to a newer, fresher face. Appearances
    shifted, like quicksand.<br>\n<br> \n<br>\nThe process did not stop there: next
    came a breaking, as the rotavator swept the ground, removing what little carpet
    of green was left. Uprooted entirely, and giving way to a light brown, dry soil,
    I felt as if we were grinding pigment in a pestle and mortar. The canvas too,
    was being stretched and defined, its dimensions becoming clear. I’ll forgive you
    for thinking that the boundaries of this task were a comforting sight. It is true,
    knowing the distance you must travel, does indeed help support your confidence
    in the journey. But here, here the distance was to the horizon, and I could not
    see to the other side. My body was confronted, with the scale of it, with its
    own minuscule nature against the expansive, devouring space of the field. I stood
    face-to-face with it, trembling."

  entry-body-text: "The following day, I returned to the field.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nToday
    we were to plough.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nThe ploughman arrived. I observed a great,
    curved, metallic toothed monster, following behind him. I spoke to him briefly,
    before he set off. He seemed confident he’d make short work of it. The plough
    dug into the ground, penetrated it, and dragged. The tractor at first jolted,
    digging in, pulled back slightly by the unrelenting grip of the soil, it was hard,
    solid, iron-willed too. But alas, it gave itself up, and the ploughman started
    his way up the field, carving the soil. Turning it over, and over, and over. *I
    could recall the soil very well, how dark it was and the smell of it—as if it
    had never before been opened up. The scent was like a forest of trees, ground
    up, layered and squeezed together*. It was like time itself had released an aroma.
    Watching soil, deep, nutrient rich soil, being summoned from the ground, was like
    seeing waves appear, when the ocean was nowhere near. It gives you a sense of
    something essential, or fundamental, when you’re near it, as if the balance of
    the universe relies on it.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nTumbling, tumbling, tumbling.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe
    plough, in its wake, formed a landscape within a landscape. A thousand landscapes.
    The slopes and jagged edges shimmered. Angle, surface, texture, size, scale, depth,
    width, height and length, all paraded in front of me. I felt a sense of vertigo
    from the infinite. Perspectives bred like rabbits in the hedgerows. And it was
    then, I formed the realisation of what the world is made of: earth. I saw what
    God must have, when forming tectonic plates, and compressing them together, to
    force a surge, an uplift, of boundless energy. An endless mountain range appeared
    before me. And I fell before it, onto my knees. It multiplied inside of me and
    I inside it.<br>\n<br>\n<br> \nCrumbling, crumbling, crumbling.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nAs
    the ploughman progressed on, field turned into battlefield. The enemy approached
    from the western flank. I arrived in fallen worlds, only to stagger, clumsily,
    into another. My feet were alien to me. I pressed on. The sun in my eyes, sweat
    at my brow and a pounding in my chest. I felt a kind of catharsis in seeing something
    ravaged other than myself. These craters, these edges, extended out of me. And
    to move through them, was as if to come to terms with them, to map them, inside
    myself. *Art is like the traces of wounds ploughed into the field*. Ploughing
    reveals more than it hides. It digs up the root of things. It mixes in, parts
    of me, reached by light, and those untouched by it. The field eats itself. To
    produce from itself. You fuel yourself in ways unknown to yourself.<br>\n<br>
    \n<br>\nI waved goodbye to the ploughman, as he left, for another field.<br>\n<br>
    \n<br>\nA job well done."

  entry-body-text: "The field was being realised, ever so quickly, in front of my
    eyes.<br>\n<br> \n<br>\nOnce I triggered the start, every stage seemed to be upon
    me.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nThe fertiliser rained down, like hail stones. Little white
    pellets of sustenance and energy, scattered: left, right, up, down. They filled
    the air and settled on the soil. Slipping into every crack and crevice produced
    by the plough. I thought it would take as long as the other work, but then the
    driver, promptly positioned himself in the middle of the field, fired up the machine,
    and commenced; within two minutes, the work was done. I was surprised at the speed
    of it, at the efficiency of the process. I merely blinked and he was gone.<br>\n<br>
    \n<br>\nWe called for the power harrow, and soon enough, within an hour or so,
    it came billowing up the lane. I thought this machine similar to the rotavator,
    but it was heavier, stronger, with far more brute force. It started, like the
    others, by travelling up and down, moving right to left. It sounded like a high
    pitched wail, escalating, as the circular drum with blades spun, gaining increased
    velocity. A pummelling. A battering. It crushed and compounded. Ushering in, wherever
    it went, a uniformity. It levelled the earth. My sea of mountains became a mill
    pond, gently undulating. Behind the machine, from the right angle, you could see
    these cliff like edges being funnelled in. After, I was left with a smooth layer
    of finely prepared soil. I ran my fingers through it.<br>\n<br> \n<br>\nAs we
    were pressed for time, they sent the crawler out too, whilst the rotavator was
    still completing the remaining half of the field. The crawler is a funny, little,
    yellow, aged machine. I remember it from when I was a boy. Over the years its
    parts have been removed, adjusted, fixed or replaced entirely. So much so, I wasn’t
    completely sure if I was looking at the same machine, or a patchwork, made of
    metal. And as its name suggests, it is a thing that crawls, on caterpillar tracks,
    thereby moving at a slower pace than most. It gave me a sense of something prehistoric,
    unleashed from a cage, as it groaned its way up the field. The crawler is tasked
    with directing the soil, balancing the flow, to create perfectly proportioned
    rows, or furrows, as they are known in the trade. These span the length of the
    field in parallel lines. These too induce vertigo, from a ceaseless progression,
    of up and down.<br> \n<br>\n<br>\nTo observe both machines move around each other,
    on the same stage, was like watching a carefully choreographed dance, between
    two people. They sped up, they slowed down, they moved over, around and across
    each other. Each added to the other’s work, to the other’s movement. They pushed
    forward, together, and before long, the field was done, prepared, ready for another’s
    entrance.<br>\n<br> \n<br>\nFor the final act, they brought a tractor and a trailer,
    carrying boxes of seed for me to plant. Thankfully, they placed these boxes along
    the furrows, at intervals twenty meters apart, to help my progression, along the
    field. I thanked them and they departed. They seemed to laugh between themselves,
    again, in disbelief. I was at last alone with no more distractions and no more
    observations. The task now fell to me, onto my shoulders."
