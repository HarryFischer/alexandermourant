- interview-text: "# North East South West\n<br>\n<br>\nSome time ago my shutter release
    cable accidentally fused through a faulty mechanism to the port of my camera.
    It stayed like that for roughly two years, and my camera and its cable became
    known as one and the same. They would not part from each other; they were, as
    they put it, as thick as thieves. Over the years my camera, forever fixed with
    an arm of sorts, a strangely thin, dangly appendage, became content with its partner.
    Rather than viewing it as a nuisance, we—my camera and I—began to interpret this
    long arm as a gift; a gift that extends, dictates and facilitates a space of play:
    a play zone where photographs can be made. When ‘the work’ takes shape, most artists
    tend to set their own parameters for the game of making. But I’ve come to notice,
    if the artist is receptive, the work, or more precisely, the apparatus—the bridge
    to the work—is more than capable of taking the lead.\n<br>\n<br>\n*North East
    South West* (2020/22) observes a farmer walking in a field from point A, to B,
    to C, and finally, to D. Respectively, these markers denote north, east, south
    and west; directions, as commonly found, in the points of a compass. The farmer,
    instructed and controlled by the 5m length of the shutter release, first walked
    clockwise, carefully strimming a line in the weeds as he went on his way. He stopped
    at each quarter point to take a photograph. Eventually, the farmer circumnavigated
    the camera itself, which sat in the centre of the field, and created a distinguishable
    outline of a circle on the face of the field. Next, the farmer, at the behest
    of the artist, continued to strim the remainder of the field, but only the field
    which lay, crucially, inside the area of the circle. The farmer grew accustomed
    to his crop circle, and began slicing and slicing at the pesky weeds, until he
    reached the earth.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe crop circle has a famed and colourful position
    in world history. The spectacle was first documented, allegedly, in *The Mowing-Devil*,
    an English woodcut pamphlet published in 1678, which tells the story of a Herefordshire
    farmer who, outraged at the cost of mowing his field, announced he’d rather the
    Devil appear and work the land. The very next morning, the farmer, repentant for
    his slurs, was stunned and terrified to witness the field cut; it was said to
    be executed with such acute precision, it would have taken “an Age for any Man
    to perform”. The ominous illustration accompanying the article shows the Devil
    with a scythe, expertly harvesting the crop in the shape of—*you guessed it*—a
    circle. Since then, the crop circle has grown in international consciousness.
    Whether attributed to pranksters, aliens or natural phenomena, baffling scientists,
    fanatics and investigators, the mythology of crop circles has become undeniable.
    It stands today as a powerful symbol of the unknown and otherworldly.\n<br>\n<br>\nHistorically,
    the crop circle has been camera shy; they were often created overnight, under
    the radar, to avoid detection. To photograph its making could be seen as the very
    undoing of its myth. *North East South West* is made not only with the camera
    in mind, but *by* and with the camera as the farmer’s accomplice. It is a quasi-crop
    circle, a rebel, one that overturns its own ontology in order to be witnessed.
    The crop circle *here* is not for agricultural necessity, but for materialising
    the enigmatic space of ‘photographic potentiality’. Although a grand and abstract
    term, put simply, it means any given space or area—due to the apparatus being
    fixed to a certain point on Earth—where photographs can be taken. Opposed to,
    say, a line or a triangle, it takes the form of a circle. A circle is like the
    sun; a circle is like a lens; and a circle is like time looped back upon itself,
    endlessly repeating—all things which, I might also add, are inherently photographic.
    *North East South West* is an ephemeral sculpture *for* photography. One that
    challenges my understanding of the image world, and the way we inhabit, roam and
    negotiate its boundaries.\n<br>\n<br>\nA few weeks passed by, and the farmer and
    the artist returned to the field, but to their dismay the crop circle was nowhere
    to be found. Together, they were adamant they knew where they’d left it, searching
    for a while amongst the tall weeds. How could such a thing ever be misplaced?
    It was as if the crop circle, under all its might, pushed and pulled itself up
    into the air, and defiantly rolled out of the field. Much like a wheel, on the
    side of a motorway, running away from a car. Its image is all that remains. Somehow,
    that felt right for the farmer and the artist; the crop circle, as we’ve come
    to learn, has always been a fugitive of sorts.\n<br>\n<br>\n*North East South
    West: The Farmer and the Crop Circle* was commissioned by Hapax Magazine, Issue
    3 (2022/2023). "
