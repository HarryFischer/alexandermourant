      "# Aomori\n<br>\n<br>\nTaken in Japan, *Aomori* follows a consistent
      trajectory in the history of art, where the colour blue is used as a demarcation
      of distance. Here, distance is not only visible through sweeping vistas and dense
      forests, but also reverberates in the knowledge that the artist worked in a country
      that was not his own. This results in a paradox, where spatial remoteness and
      distance simultaneously evoke an emotional closeness, for both the artist and
      the viewer.<br>\n<br>\nJust as you enter a forest and become surrounded by ancient
      branches and roots, the photographs by Alexander Mourant engulf you in a similar
      way, taking you on a mysterious voyage where both sorrow and beauty are tied together.
      The result is a silent mediation on space, both physically, in what is being photographed,
      and also in regard to time. These photographs feel ancient and respectful, just
      as the forests and hills have taken centuries to form. It seems as though their
      very essence has taken a physical form.<br>\n<br>\n*Aomori* is the Japanese for
      ‘blue forest’ - a literal translation of many of the works. Achieved in camera
      by using a church’s stained glass window - which was cut to make a lens filter
      - the spiritual history of the process seeps through into the image, to a time
      when the land was a place of worship. The blue is therefore not just for aesthetic
      effect, but pulses the landscapes. As the American writer Rebecca Solnit writes,
      ‘The world is blue at its edges and in its depths’. \n<br>\n<br>\nIntroduction
