    First Edition](https://www.folium.site/shop/p/alex-mourant-the-night-and-the-first-sculpture)\n[Available
    here: Special Edition](https://www.folium.site/shop/p/thenightandthefirstsculpture-specialedition)\n<br>\n<br>\n*The
    Night and the First Sculpture* (2024) is Alexander Mourant’s first publication,
    containing sculptures, performances and photographs, made on his family farm.
    Responding, firstly, to Robert Smithson’s *Island of Broken Glass* (1969/1970),
    the work evolved through playful, material-led exploration, to question the metaphysical
    nature of images and concepts of time, space and place.\n\nMade under the cover
    of night, Mourant’s process was one of metaphorically imbuing and assembling agricultural
    materials – glass, wood and stone – in an attempt to materialise his own theories,
    often referencing novels, non-fiction, autobiography and mythologies. As Alan
    Huck writes, “The approach that Mourant takes is not unlike what Wordsworth proclaimed
    was the task of the poet – to build up the greatest things from the least suggestions.”
    \n\nIn this work, the artist’s ad hoc farm-studio performs, becoming a stage or
    a theatre for the conjuring of images. This ‘black box’ hints at the origins of
    photography and the camera as architecture; one seemingly infinite, with a void-like
    substance and hard to define scale. Here, the night transforms into a character,
    encapsulating desire, the unknown and the artist’s pursuit of knowledge.\n\nAt
    its heart, *The Night and the First Sculpture* proposes how images and stories
    may form, erode and reshape themselves over time. Mourant continues to draw upon
    research into Conceptualism’s cognate movements – Land Art, Arte Povera and Mono-ha
    – to help expand or ‘push’ our understanding of the image world.\n\n*The Night
    and the First Sculpture* includes an essay by Alan Huck, and an in conversation
    with Eugenie Shinkle and Alexander Mourant. \n\nPublished by Folium, 2024. \nSupported
    by ArtHouse Jersey\n\nFirst Edition of 200\n176mm x 225mm\n96 pages\nSection sewn\nHardback"
