    First Edition (200)](https://www.folium.site/shop/p/alex-mourant-the-night-and-the-first-sculpture)<br>\n[Available
    now: Special Edition (20 +2APs)](https://www.folium.site/shop/p/thenightandthefirstsculpture-specialedition)\n<br>\n<br>\n*The
    Night and the First Sculpture* (2024) is Alexander Mourant’s first publication,
    containing sculptures, performances and photographs, made on his family farm.
    Responding, firstly, to Robert Smithson’s *Island of Broken Glass* (1969/1970),
    the work evolved through playful, material-led exploration, to question the metaphysical
    nature of images and concepts of time, space and place.\n<br>\n<br>\nMade under
    the cover of night, Mourant’s process was one of metaphorically imbuing and assembling
    agricultural materials – glass, wood and stone – in an attempt to materialise
    his own theories, often referencing novels, non-fiction, autobiography and mythologies.
    As Alan Huck writes, “The approach that Mourant takes is not unlike what Wordsworth
    proclaimed was the task of the poet – to build up the greatest things from the
    least suggestions.” \n<br>\n<br>\nIn this work, the artist’s ad hoc farm-studio
    performs, becoming a stage or a theatre for the conjuring of images. This ‘black
    box’ hints at the origins of photography and the camera as architecture; one seemingly
    infinite, with a void-like substance and hard to define scale. Here, the night
    transforms into a character, encapsulating desire, the unknown and the artist’s
    pursuit of knowledge.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt its heart, *The Night and the First Sculpture*
    proposes how images and stories may form, erode and reshape themselves over time.
    Mourant continues to draw upon research into Conceptualism’s cognate movements
    – Land Art, Arte Povera and Mono-ha – to help expand or ‘push’ our understanding
    of the image world.\n<br>\n<br>\n*The Night and the First Sculpture* includes
    an essay by Alan Huck, and an in conversation with Eugenie Shinkle and Alexander
    Mourant. \n<br>\n<br>\nPublished by Folium, 2024.<br> \nSupported by ArtHouse
